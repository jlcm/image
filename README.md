To upload images

** You can upload your two images to a public GitHub repository, and the raw file URLs will be accessible like this
How to do it:
Create a public GitHub repository (or use an existing one)
Upload both images to the root (or any folder)
Use the raw links (you can get them by clicking on the image → "Download" → copy link)

Needed to test cloudinary URLs where the source image URL is the same except for the extension (i.e., .jpg, .png)
